           Bob has a friend, Jill, who has driven a Buick for many years.
           Bob therefore thinks that Jill drives an American car. He is not aware,
           however, that her Buick has recently been stolen, and he is also not
           aware that Jill has replaced it with a Pontiac, which is a different
           kind of American car.
