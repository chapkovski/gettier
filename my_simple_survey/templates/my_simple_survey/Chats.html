    <p> You are now in a chat room with a person who gave the opposite answer to you.
        Each player should try to convince the other player of his/her answer.
        After debating for (at most) 4 minutes, you will both be given a chance to
        change your original answer.
        <br><br>
        Player 1 should begin by explaining his/her answer to Player 2.
        <br><br>
        For your reference, here is the case again.

           Bob has a friend, Jill, who has driven a Buick for many years.
           Bob therefore thinks that Jill drives an American car. He is not aware,
           however, that her Buick has recently been stolen, and he is also not
           aware that Jill has replaced it with a Pontiac, which is a different
           kind of American car.
           <br><br>
           <b>
               Does Bob know that Jill drives an American car?
           </b>
