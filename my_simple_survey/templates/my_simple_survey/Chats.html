    <p> You are now in a chat room with a person who gave the opposite answer to you.
        <br><br>
        Player 1: Begin by explaining to Player 2 why you answered as you did.
        <br><br>
        Player 2: After Player 1 has explained their respose,
        you should then try to convince Player 1 of your own response!
        <br><br>
        Both players will be able to change their minds after chatting.
        <br><br>
        In 4 minutes, you will be advanced to the Demographics page. You may not need
        all of that time to chat to each other, but please ensure that you take enough
        time to write clearly.
        <br><br>
        For your reference, here is the description again. Beneath it is a chat box
        where you can text each other.

           Bob has a friend, Jill, who has driven a Buick for many years.
           Bob therefore thinks that Jill drives an American car. He is not aware,
           however, that her Buick has recently been stolen, and he is also not
           aware that Jill has replaced it with a Pontiac, which is a different
           kind of American car.
           <br><br>
           <b>
               Does Bob know that Jill drives an American car?
           </b>
