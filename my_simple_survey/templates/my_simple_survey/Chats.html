    Welcome To Your Chat!

    <p> You are now in a chat room with a person who gave the opposite answer to you.
        Each player should try to convince the other player of his/her answer.
        After debating for (at most) 4 minutes, you will both be given a chance to
        change your original answer. Player 1 should begin by explaining
        his/her answer to Player 2.
        For your reference, here is the original case:
    <p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em;">
        {{ vignette }}
        <br><br>
        <b>
            Does Bob know that Jill drives an American car?
        </b>
    </p>
    <br>
    Use this chat box to talk to the other player:
    {% chat %}


    {% next_button %}
