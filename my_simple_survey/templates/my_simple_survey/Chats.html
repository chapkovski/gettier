    Welcome To Your Chat

    <p> You can now chat with another "player" who gave the opposite answer to you.
        Use the chat below to try to convince the other player that your position is
        the correct one.
        <br>
        Player 1, please begin by explaining to Player 2 why you answered as you did.
        <br> 
        Player 2: After Player 1 has attempted to change your mind, you should try
        to convince Player 2 of your response.
        <br>
        You will both be given the opportunity to change your minds after chatting.
        <br>
        After 4 minutes, you will be forced to complete the study. It is possible
        that you will not need all of that time to chat, but please ensure that
        you take enough time to write clearly.
    <br>
    Here is the scenario again for your reference:
   <br>
    <p style="border:2px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em;">
           <br>
           Bob has a friend, Jill, who has driven a Buick for many years.
           Bob therefore thinks that Jill drives an American car. He is not aware,
           however, that her Buick has recently been stolen, and he is also not
           aware that Jill has replaced it with a Pontiac, which is a different
           kind of American car.
           <br><br>
           <b>
               Does Bob know that Jill drives an American car? <br>
           </b>
       </p>
